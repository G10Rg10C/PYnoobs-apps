Autoclicker = This script simulates the click of the left button of your mouse until you stop it thousands time per minute, there are more versions

Print Hello world = the simplest script ever, it doesn't need explanations

NameGame= a simple stupid script game to exercise on the if, else ecc., try it

DMSbomb= I'm pretty proud of it, you can use it when you meet a scammer or similar, it basically sends thousand pre-written messages  into a textbox and sends them to the 
scammer or victim of the prank.

Roulette= A simple homemade roulet program but I didn't upload the background so it's possible that one or two of them won't work, to avoid this tell me and I'll upload it with the roulette image.

ContaCaratteri = a simple script to enumerate the number of letters in the text.

Those scripts are all ready to use; just download them and use them. If you don't have the libraries I used, all you have to do is install them on the correct path with "pip install."

Have fun and good time!!
